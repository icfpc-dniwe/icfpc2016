* specs
A silhouette specification consists of the following items, each in one line.
- the number of polygons
- for each polygon, the number of vertices
- for each vertex, its coordinates

A skeleton is a set of edges and folding line segments of the origami. A skeleton is specified by the following items, each in one line:
- the number of line segments
- for each line segment, the coordinates of its two vertices, separated by a space
The skeleton specification must employ the least number of line segments; any two line segments that lie on a same line must be disjoint.
